<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello! I'm Maryam, an aspiring software engineer and web developer. My passion lies in creating intuitive and dynamic web applications that enhance user experiences.</p>

<h2>My Journey in Aarhus, Denmark</h2>
<p>My journey in web development took a significant turn when I moved to Aarhus, Denmark. The city's vibrant tech community
and its blend of historic charm with modern innovation have been an endless source of inspiration. Being here has not
only been about discovering the streets of Aarhus but also about diving deep into the world of coding and web design.</p>

<h3>Hack Your Future: My Stepping Stone</h3>
<p>Currently, I'm honing my skills at Hack Your Future, an esteemed coding school known for its intensive courses and emphasis on real-world application. The curriculum, combined with hands-on projects, has equipped me with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p>Every class, every project, and every line of code has been a step towards my goal of becoming a top-tier web developer.</p>
<h4>Portfolio Highlights</h4>
<p>While I'm always learning and growing, I'm particularly proud of a few projects I've developed during my time at Hack
Your Future. <a href="Projects.html"></a></p>
<h5>Aarhus & Coding: A Perfect Blend</h5>
<ul>
    <li>While coding, my favorite spot in Aarhus is the Dokk1 library overlooking the harbor.</li>
    <li>The collaborative spirit of Hack Your Future reminds me of the community vibes at the Aarhus Festuge.</li>
    <li>I will blend Danish design principles into my web designs, aiming for functionality wrapped in elegance.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Let's Collaborate!</h6>
<p>I'm always on the lookout for challenging projects and collaboration opportunities. If you're in need of a dedicated web
