Ingredients:

1 pre-made pizza dough or pizza crust
1/2 cup pizza sauce
1 1/2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese
6-8 strips of bacon, cooked and crumbled
1/4 cup diced red onion
1/4 cup sliced black olives
1/4 cup sliced fresh mushrooms
1/4 teaspoon dried oregano
1/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper flakes (optional, for heat)
Fresh basil leaves (for garnish, optional)


Instructions:

Preheat your oven to the temperature recommended on the pizza dough or crust packaging. Typically, it's around 450°F (230°C).

Roll out the pizza dough on a lightly floured surface to your desired thickness. If you're using a pre-made crust, follow the package instructions.

Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone, pizza pan, or baking sheet lined with parchment paper.

Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges for the crust.

Sprinkle most of the shredded mozzarella cheese over the sauce, reserving some for the top.

Add the crumbled bacon, diced red onion, sliced black olives, and sliced mushrooms on top of the cheese.

Sprinkle the dried oregano and crushed red pepper flakes (if using) over the toppings.

Finish by adding the remaining mozzarella cheese on top.

Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake according to the dough or crust package instructions. Typically, it takes 12-15 minutes, or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling and lightly browned.

Carefully remove the pizza from the oven and let it cool for a minute or two.

Optionally, garnish your bacon pizza with fresh basil leaves for added flavor and a pop of color.

Slice the pizza, serve, and enjoy your delicious homemade bacon pizza!

Feel free to customize your bacon pizza by adding your favorite toppings or experimenting with different cheeses. Enjoy!
