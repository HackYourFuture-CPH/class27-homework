Our easy green chicken enchilada recipe is weeknight ready and all but guaranteed to please everyone from starving spouses to picky toddlers. Here’s how to make these simple sour cream chicken enchiladas:

Season some shredded chicken—if you’re like us and usually have some cooked chicken in the fridge, use that! If not, you can use the meat from a store-bought rotisserie chicken.
Toss the chicken with shredded Monterey Jack cheese and mozzarella—these mild, milky cheeses melt like no other, and meld beautifully with this enchilada recipe’s sour cream-based filling.
Warm the tortillas and give them a dip in some green enchilada sauce (from a can—this recipe is all about ease) before you fill and bake them.
Fill, roll and arrange the tortillas in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Pour green enchilada sauce over the whole gorgeous mess, top with a little more cheese, and bake until bubbly. Since the chicken is cooked, all the bake needs to do is help the whole thing cohere—once the cheese is really melted and bubbling, your green enchiladas are done!
