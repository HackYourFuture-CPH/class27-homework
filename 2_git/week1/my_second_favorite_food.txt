CHOCOLATE CUPCAKES & VANILLA FROSTING

INGREDIENTS:

Cupcakes:

2 ounces (55 g) dark chocolate (55% to 60%), very finely chopped (use vegan if following vegan diet)
1/3 cup (29 g) sifted Dutch processed cocoa
3/4 cup (180 ml) boiling water
3/4 cup (109 g) low FODMAP gluten-free all-purpose flour that contains xanthan, such as Bob's Red Mill 1 to 1 Gluten Free Baking Flour
3/4 cup (149 g) sugar
1/2 teaspoon baking soda
1/2 teaspoon salt
1/3 cup (75 ml) vegetable oil
2 large eggs, at room temperature
2 teaspoons distilled white vinegar
2 teaspoons vanilla extract
Frosting: Make 1 batch of Vanilla Frosting, while cupcakes cool


PREPARATION:

For the Cupcakes: Position rack in center of oven. Preheat oven to 350°F/180° Line 12 cupcake wells with fluted paper cups; set aside.

Place very finely chopped chocolate and cocoa in a heatproof bowl. Pour the boiling water over the chocolate/cocoa mixture and allow to sit for 5 minutes. Whisk gently until chocolate is melted and mixture is combined. Cool until just tepid.
Meanwhile, place the flour, sugar, baking soda and salt in a large bowl and whisk to aerate and combine; make a well in the center. In another bowl whisk together the oil, eggs, vinegar and vanilla. Whisk the barely warm chocolate mixture into the oil mixture. Pour the wet mixture over the dry and whisk until well combined and smooth. The batter will be very liquidy. Divide batter in prepared cupcake wells (an ice cream scoop makes quick and clean work of this). Bake cupcakes for about 15 to 20 minutes, rotating the pans front to back once during baking. When done the tops should spring back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted in the center should show a few moist crumbs clinging. Place pan(s) on a cooling rack for 5 minutes, then unmold cupcakes and cool upright. (If you want to freeze cupcakes for future use, place in zip top bags with air removed and freeze for up to 1 month. Defrost in refrigerator).
For the Frosting: While cupcakes are cooling, make the frosting. 
Frost cupcakes once they are completely cooled. You can use a small offset spatula to create a casual look to apply frosting or use a pastry bag and star tip to create beautiful swirls. Frosted cupcakes are ready to serve or store in a single layer in an airtight container at room temperature and are best served within 24 hours.
