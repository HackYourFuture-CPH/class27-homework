        Chicken burger recipe

Ingredients
    1 chicken breast
    1 tsp chipotle paste
    1 lime, juiced
    1-2 slices cheese
    1 brioche bun, split
    ½ avocado
    2 cherry tomatoes, chopped
    3-4 pickled jalapeño slices, chopped
    ½ small garlic clove, finely grated

STEP 1
Put the chicken breast between two pieces of cling film 
and bash with a rolling pin or pan to about 1cm thick. 
Mix the chipotle paste with half the lime juice 
and spread over the chicken.

STEP 2
Heat a griddle pan over a high heat. 
Once hot, cook the chicken for 3 mins each side 
until cooked through, adding the cheese 
for the final 2 mins of cooking. 
Add the bun, cut-side down, to the griddle pan to toast lightly. 
Season the chicken.

STEP 3
Meanwhile, mash the avocado with the remaining lime juice. 
Stir in the cherry tomatoes, jalapeño and garlic, 
and season with a little salt. 
Spread over the base of the bun, then add the chicken 
followed by the top of the bun.
