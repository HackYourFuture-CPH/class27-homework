Heat 2 tablespoons oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until deep golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir in turmeric for 1 to 2 minutes.


Add chuck cubes; cook until coated in turmeric and browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes.


Heat remaining 2 tablespoons oil in a separate pot over medium heat. Add spinach, green onions, parsley, cilantro, chives, and fenugreek leaves; cook and stir until deep dark green in color, 5 to 10 minutes.


Stir spinach mixture into onion and chuck mixture. Pour in enough water to create a slurry consistency. Season with salt and pepper. Stir in lemon juice. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer stew until greens soften, about 1 hour.


Pierce dried limes with a fork; add to stew.


Continue simmering until chuck is tender, 30 minutes to 1 hour. Stir in red kidney beans. Cook until flavors combine, about 30 more minutes.

S
Discard dried limes before serving.


Tips
Substitute lamb stew meat for the chuck roast if preferred.
