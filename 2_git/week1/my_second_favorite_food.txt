What we LOVE about this ultra easy quesadilla recipe, is that there is no frying involved. When making baked chicken quesadillas in the oven you can avoid standing over the stove and go straight to cooking ten cheesy, mouth watering, perfectly toasted homemade quesadillas at once that go from oven to instant party platter in no time.

Mix cooked, shredded chicken with cheese, sour cream, chipotle peppers and seasoning in a bowl.
Fill half of a tortilla with ⅓ cup of that delicious filling.
Fold the quesadilla in half.
Arrange 4-5 prepared quesadillas on a large baking sheet.
Brush tortillas with olive oil.
Bake at 425°F for 15 minutes.
Enjoy the best quesadilla recipe ever!
