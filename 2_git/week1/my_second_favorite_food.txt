Ingredients:

8 ounces (about 225 grams) of spaghetti or your preferred pasta
2 cups of your favorite tomato sauce
1-2 cloves of garlic, minced
2 tablespoons olive oil
Salt and black pepper to taste
Grated Parmesan cheese (optional, for garnish)
Fresh basil leaves or parsley (optional, for garnish)


Instructions:

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Once boiling, add the spaghetti and cook according to the package instructions until al dente (usually about 8-10 minutes).

While the pasta is cooking, heat the olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the minced garlic and sauté for about 1-2 minutes until it becomes fragrant and lightly golden. Be careful not to let it brown too much, as it can become bitter.

Pour in the tomato sauce and stir. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Allow the sauce to simmer on low heat for a few minutes, letting the flavors meld together.

Once the pasta is done cooking, drain it in a colander.

Return the cooked and drained pasta to the pot.

Pour the tomato sauce over the cooked pasta and toss to coat the pasta evenly with the sauce.

Serve your spaghetti on plates or in bowls. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese and fresh basil leaves or parsley, if desired.

Enjoy your simple and delicious pasta dish!
